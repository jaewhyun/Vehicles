# Vehicles
BU MET CS231 Project 3

Implement a “generic” Vehicle class that includes data members to represent a vehicle’s make, model, production year, and price. The class interface includes methods that provide appropriate access to the data members. Derive a Car class, a Truck class, and a Plane class from Vehicle. Each of these derived classes should add appropriate data members and methods (use your imagination).

For the Vehicle class hierarchy, provide at least the following virtual methods:

Start, which outputs the steps to start the vehicle (use your imagination).
DisplayWindowSticker, which outputs information about the vehicle.

Write a C++ program to keep track of at least 6 different vehicles by storing them in an “array”. No more than two vehicles are of the same class.

Additional requirements:

Use specification and implementation files
Test all public methods
